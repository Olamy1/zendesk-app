# Zendesk App v2.1 Enhancement Roadmap ‚Äî From Reporting to Intelligence

**Date:** October 2025
**Version:** v2.1
**Author:** Olivier Lamy

---

## üéØ Objective

Transition the Zendesk Bi-Weekly Reporting App from a reactive reporting interface into an intelligent, insight-driven platform.
Version 2.1 introduces two proactive intelligence layers ‚Äî **Root-Cause Analysis** and **Meeting Auto-Briefing** ‚Äî designed to help leadership identify systemic issues early and reduce manual meeting prep time.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Enhancement Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Root-Cause Intelligence Layer (High Impact, Low Build Friction)

**Goal:** Automatically detect recurring failure or delay patterns in Zendesk tickets to reveal systemic issues.

#### Why It Matters

* Current reporting identifies *what* is happening (e.g., tickets by type, by age) but not *why*.
* By applying lightweight NLP clustering to ticket subjects and notes, directors can see emerging issues (e.g., ‚Äúpolicy clarification,‚Äù ‚Äúportal access,‚Äù ‚Äúdata request‚Äù).

#### Implementation

##### Backend (`/api/insights/root_causes`)

* **Input:** Ticket subjects, internal notes, and tags (pulled from `/tickets`).
* **Processing:**

  * Use `KeyBERT` or `scikit-learn` TF-IDF clustering to group tickets by semantic similarity.
  * Identify top recurring clusters + their delta vs last meeting cycle.
* **Output (JSON):**

  ```json
  {
    "cycle_start": "2025-10-08",
    "cycle_end": "2025-10-21",
    "themes": [
      {"topic": "Portal Access Issues", "tickets": 14, "change": "+5"},
      {"topic": "Policy Clarification", "tickets": 9, "change": "-2"}
    ]
  }
  ```
* **Storage:** Archive to `/docs/insights/root_cause_{cycle}.json` and SharePoint.

##### Frontend (New Tab: *Insights*)

* Display a sortable table with columns:

  * Theme | Ticket Count | Œî vs Last Cycle.
* Visualize trends using Recharts or Chart.js (stacked bar).
* Add tooltips (e.g., ‚ÄúDetected via NLP clustering on ticket subjects and notes‚Äù).

##### Value Delivered

* Directors walk into meetings understanding *why* tickets exist ‚Äî not just how many.
* Enables pattern detection and proactive resolution before the next cycle.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Meeting Auto-Briefing (Natural Language Summarization)

**Goal:** Auto-generate concise executive summaries from Zendesk data to minimize meeting prep time.

#### Why It Matters

* Manual report compilation and summarization are time-consuming.
* This enhancement provides directors with a 2-minute meeting brief summarizing key shifts in the last 14 days.

#### Implementation

##### Backend (`/api/insights/meeting_brief`)

* **Input:** Ticket changes from `compute_meeting_window()`.
* **Aggregation:**

  * Count total created, closed, reopened, reassigned.
  * Identify top 3 blockers (by volume or ticket age).
* **Generation:**

  * Use Jinja2 templating or lightweight text generation (optionally LLM-assisted, e.g., local GPT-4-mini).

  ```
  Between Oct 8‚ÄìOct 21:
  ‚Ä¢ 24 tickets closed (+20%)
  ‚Ä¢ 6 reassignments (most to Policy)
  ‚Ä¢ 3 reopened (R&A themes)
  Top Blockers: Portal Access, Data Requests, Clarification Delays.
  ```
* **Output:** `/docs/briefings/{cycle}.txt` + SharePoint upload.

##### Frontend (Dashboard Integration)

* Add a ‚Äúüìã Briefing‚Äù button to the dashboard header.
* On click: modal view showing briefing text with ‚ÄúDownload PDF‚Äù and ‚ÄúUpload to SharePoint‚Äù options.

##### Value Delivered

* Leadership can consume critical metrics instantly.
* Converts meeting prep from a 45-minute task to a 2-minute read.
